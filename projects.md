# Projects

* Organization: Institute of Technical Physics, KIT, Germany (7 months) -
  A mathematical model to characterize the superconducting level sensor is developed using steady-state heat balance equations and is validated through experiment. Experimental performance analysis of a superconducting level sensor is conducted under different gaseous flow conditions in the cryostat.

* Organization: General Motors India (GMI) Pvt. Ltd. (2 months) -
  Implementation of the critical parts for NGS SDE 1.3L (small diesel engine) for the start of production.

* Organization: Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC, ISRO) (6 months) -
  Designed tested and validated a solar array drive assembly (SADA) cone made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP), which is used to avoid the transmission of vibration from the solar panel to the satellite body.
