# Projects
* **Cryogas Pvt Ltd** (1 year)-
  Optimization of the chill-down operation in a high presure and a low pressure cryogenic transfer lines using LH2 and LOX cryogenic fluid. 

* **ISRO Propulsion complex** (3 years) -
  Development of a numerical program called FloNAT (Flow Network Analyzer for Two-phase) for modelling two-phase chill-down operation in cryogenic feed lines. 

* **Institute of Technical Physics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany** (7 months) -
  A mathematical model to characterize the superconducting level sensor is developed using steady-state heat balance equations and is validated through experiment. Experimental performance analysis of a superconducting level sensor is conducted under different gaseous flow conditions in the cryostat.

* **General Motors India (GMI) Pvt. Ltd.** (2 months) -
  Implementation of the critical parts for NGS SDE 1.3L (small diesel engine) for the start of production.

* **Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC, ISRO)** (6 months) -
  Designed tested and validated a solar array drive assembly (SADA) cone made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP), which is used to avoid the transmission of vibration from the solar panel to the satellite body.
