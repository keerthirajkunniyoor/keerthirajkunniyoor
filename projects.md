## Projects
* **Cryogas Equipment Private limited, Gujarat, India** (1 year)-
  Optimization of the chill-down operation in a high presure and a low pressure cryogenic transfer line setups having various flow components using LH2 and LOX cryogenic fluids. 

* **ISRO Propulsion Complex (IPRC), Tamil Nadu, India** (3 years) -
  Development of a numerical program called FloNAT (Flow Network Analyzer for Two-phase) for modelling two-phase chill-down operation in cryogenic feed lines. 

* **Institute of Technical Physics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany** (7 months) -
  -	A mathematical model to characterize the superconducting level sensor is developed using steady-state heat balance equations and is validated through experiment. 
  -	Experimental performance analysis of a superconducting level sensor is conducted under different gaseous flow conditions in a cryostat.

* **General Motors India (GMI) Pvt. Ltd., Maharashtra, India** (2 months) -
  Implementation of the critical parts for NGS SDE 1.3L small diesel engine (Chevrolet Enjoy) for the start of production.

* **Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC, ISRO), Kerala, India** (6 months) -
  Designed, tested and validated a solar array drive assembly (SADA) cone made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP), which is used to avoid the transmission of vibration from the solar panel to the satellite body.
